# API Mashup - Weather and Event Web App
This is an API mashup done for my second assignment for my Web Development course at the University of Dundee. It combines two API's, the Weather API and the TicketMaster API, to allow users to search for events in a particular location while also checking the weather conditions and forecast in that area.

Users enter a chosen location into the search bar and the appliction updates itself with the weather forecast, and events in the area

Users can then click on the event, and they will be taken to the relevant webpage where they can book tickets or seats to the events.
